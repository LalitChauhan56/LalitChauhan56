Hi there!👋 I'm Lalit Chauhan, a third year student studying Computer Science Engineering at JECRC University, Jaipur. I'm passionate about coding and software development, and I love to learn new programming languages and technologies.
I believe that open source is a great way to learn from experienced developers and give back to the community, and I'm always looking for new opportunities to collaborate. 👀
In addition to coding, I enjoy gaming and cheering for Checo 🏎️. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or just want to chat! 💕
